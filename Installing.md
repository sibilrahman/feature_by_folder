## Use this package as a library

### Depend on it

Run this command:

With Flutter:

`flutter pub add --dev feature_by_folder`


This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  feature: 
 ```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.
